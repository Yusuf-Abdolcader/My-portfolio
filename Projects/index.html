<p>I want everything
    I need everything,I am everything 
    If I die can you restart me
    Because even though life is hard
    I"m still apart of it
    Saying stop is another word for giving up 
    Giving up means 
    you stop before the rollercoaster before you
    you get off the ride
    from going up and down
     if you don't going on the rollercoaster more than once
     you'll never change
    don't act like you can go back in time like your doctor strange
    you can't change the past you can only predict the future
    If you don't fall out your ways you'll end up with lucifer </p>
